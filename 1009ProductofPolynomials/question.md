# 1009 Product of Polynomials (25 分)
This time, you are supposed to find A×B where A and B are two polynomials.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial:
K N<sub>1</sub>a​<sub>N​<sub>1</sub>​​ </sub>​​  N<sub>​2​​</sub>  a<sub>​N​<sub>2</sub>​​ ​​</sub>  ... N<sub>​K​​</sub>a​<sub>N​<sub>K</sub>​​</sub> ​​ 
where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, N
​i​​  and a​N​i​​ 
​​  (i=1,2,⋯,K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that 1≤K≤10, 0≤N<sub>K​​</sub> <⋯<N​<sub>2</sub>​​ <N<sub>​1</sub>​​ ≤1000.

## Output Specification:
For each test case you should output the product of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate up to 1 decimal place.

## Sample Input:
```
2 1 2.4 0 3.2
2 2 1.5 1 0.5
```
## Sample Output:
```
3 3 3.6 2 6.0 1 1.6
```
